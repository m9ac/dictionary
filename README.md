# dictionary
This is a pretty simple python tool to interface with the webster learner dictionary api
It allows you to search for a specific vocabulary word and prints out the query response in formatted json

More work needs to be done to limit the quesry response to specific search parameters ie definitions, part of speech, usw

any help is appreciated
it is for the kids
think of the kids
do it for the kids


kids!
