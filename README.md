# dictionary
This is a pretty simple python tool to interface with the webster learner dictionary api\n
It allows you to search for a specific vocabulary word and prints out the query response in formatted json\n

More work needs to be done to limit the quesry response to specific search parameters ie definitions, part of speech, usw\n

any help is appreciated\n
it is for the kids\n
think of the kids\n
do it for the kids\n
kids!
